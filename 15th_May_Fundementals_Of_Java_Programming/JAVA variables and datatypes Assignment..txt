Q1. What is statically typed and dynamically typed programming language?
Ans: Programming languages are referred to as statically typed if the memory of the variables is provided at the time of compilation.
For example: C, C++, JAVA.


Q2. What is the variables in the Java?
Ans: A variable is the name of the memory location assigned to store the values. It is a container that holds the values during execution of a Java program.


Q3. How to assign a value to a variable?
Ans: for assigning a value we use assignment (=) operator.


Int num = 10;
Float b = 9.5;


Q4. What are the primitive data types in Java?
Ans: Byte, short, long, float, int, char, double, boolean.


Q5. What are Identifiers in Java?

In Java, an identifier is a sequence of letters, digits, and underscore characters.


Q6. List the operators in Java?
Ans: Operators in Java are:
* Unary Operator,
* Arithmetic Operator,
* Shift Operator,
* Relational Operator,
* Bitwise Operator,
* Logical Operator,
* Ternary Operator and
* Assignment Operator.


Q7. Explain about increment and decrement operator and give an example?
Ans: Increment operator in Java is used to increase the value by 1.
For example: int i=1 and i++ . It increases the value of i by 1.
Increment operators are of two types:
1. Prefix increment operator = ++i.
2. Postfix increment operator = i++.


Decrement operator in Java is used to decrease the value by 1.
For example: int i=10; i-- . It decreases the value by 1.
Decrement operators are of two types:
3. Prefix decrement operator = --i.
4. Postfix decrement operator = i--.
